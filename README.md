# DABI

dabi is a minimal approach to an to-do app inspired from [Cal Newport's book](http://calnewport.com/books/straight-a-student/ "How To Become a Straight-A Student"). Its primary purpose is to support the creation of realistic completion oriented tasks.

### Techonology

dabi is built on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) with [materializecss](http://next.materializecss.com) (just for the stylized check box - sue me).
It runs on top of [Habitica](https://habitica.com/)'s API.
